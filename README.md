# Image-To-PDF-using-Python
A python based desktop application to automate the extremely slow and boring task of copying and pasting images to docx file and further resizing 

This application automises the boring procedure of copying all images and pasting in document which is very slow process,
    and may also sometimes lead to freezing of your application. However, this is extremely fast compared to 
    performing the same task in word processing softwares. Moreover, this program resizes the images taking into account the aspect ratio
    of the images which further minimizes the boring task of formatting each image one by one.    

   Key notes:
       Add all images to be converted into a pdf file in the images folder of this application
       The order of images to be present in pdf would be the same as the filenames sorted by name in ascending order(ignoring case)
       Add a name to the docx file("Excluding extension") and keep going :)
